## About the game

Markdown Matchup is a memory game that educates players about the syntac for markdown programming. 

Markdown is a lightweight coding language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. It is widely used in blogging, instant messaging, online forums, collaborative software, documentation pages, and readme files. By learning the syntax, the symbols used to set the formatting of text, you can easily style your website pages. 

Markdown Memory helps you learn markdown syntax. By looking through cards, you can match pairs of syntax and formatting. For example, "`**markdown matchup**`" bolds the text so it matches with "**markdown matchup**".
